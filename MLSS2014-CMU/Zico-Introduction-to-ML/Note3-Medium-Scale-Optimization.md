## Mathematical optimization

- Search problems v.s. Mathematical programming
	- Search problems: discrete, finite, exponential
	- Mathematical programs: Continuous, Infinite, Polynomial(sometimes)

- Formal definition
	- minimize_x f(x), x is the optimization variable, f is an objective function
	- subject to g_i(x) <=0, g are (inequality) constraint functions
	- feasible region: {x: g_i(x) <=0, for any i=1..m}
