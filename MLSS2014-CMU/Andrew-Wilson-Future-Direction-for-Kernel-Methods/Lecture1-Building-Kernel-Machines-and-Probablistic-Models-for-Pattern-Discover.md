### Machine Learning
- Create algorithms that can learn and make decisions without human interactions, but not to equip humans with tools to analyze data

- Building intelligent kernel
	- Support: what solutions we think are a priori possible
	- Inductive biases: what solutions we think are a priori likely

- Statistics from Scratch
	- Regularization
		- use a penalized log likelihood(or error function), such as 
- Bayers Inferences
	- Bayes Rules
	- Pros
		- no over-fitting
- Representing Uncertainty
	- uncertainty through lack of knowledge
	- intrinsic uncertainty, e.g. radioactive decay
- Regularization
