Regression
==========

###Files
- **regression.py**: implement linear regression
- **lwlr.py**: implement locally weighted linear regression 
- **plotFig.py**: plot original data points and regression line
- **predictAge.py": an example to predict age of animals
- **ridgeRegression": solve the case when the number of features is large than the number of samples, by adding a lambda matrix
- **stepWise.py**: similar to lasso which is an alternative way of ridgeRegression(but could help better understanding the data). 

- **TODO**: page 152-158 example
